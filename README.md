# Computational Thinking Assignment – News Articles Analysis

This notebook was produced for a course assignment in **Computational Thinking**.  
The goal was to extract publication dates from raw text, transform them into weekly bins, and visualize article frequency.

The approach reflects how an applied economist would structure a problem:
- **Decomposition** → break down the task (extract → transform → visualize)  
- **Transformation** → process raw data into structured information  
- **Visualization** → communicate results clearly  

It is **not optimized for efficiency**, but instead illustrates clear step-by-step logic and algorithmic thinking.
